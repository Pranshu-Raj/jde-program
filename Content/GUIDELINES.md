# Branding and Styling Guide for DevLake

**Last Revised: July 15th, 2022**
This style and brand guide covers the most important messaging, branding, and style requirements for presenting and sharing DevLake in any public-facing content. Content that does not adhere to the guidelines and style-guide will require updating or removal to avoid creating issues or confusion. 
  
- DevLake is always written and displayed with a capitalized "D" and capitalized "L" (DevLake, NOT Devlake, devlake, or devLake, etc.)

- When writing or presenting Apache DevLake in blogs, social-media, or presentations, the status of the project's incubation must be properly expressed with the "incubating" addition. (Apache DevLake (incubating), NOT Apache DevLake)
  - Note: The requirement to include "(incubating)" is a requirement of the Apache Software Foundation's (ASF) incubator program, and is vitally important to adhere to. 
  - Note: When DevLake has successfully "graduated" from the ASF incubator program, the DevLake core team will inform the community, and update the branding guidelines accordingly. 

- When using graphics content (screenshots, UI snippets, etc.) in blogs or social-media posts, please make an effort to verify that the content is current, and that it reflects the most recent release/version of DevLake. When in doubt, verify with one of the DevLake core leadership team (listed below.) 

- When sharing the DevLake brand (logos, identity, graphics) please default to using the logos and graphics maintained by the core leadership team in this folder: https://merico.feishu.cn/drive/folder/fldcnJpP6zDMHJn0ark84YbSqUg?from=from_copylink

- When writing about the relationship between DevLake and Merico it can be expressed that Merico launched the DevLake project, and that Merico is the lead supporter and maintainer of DevLake. However, it should NOT be written as "Merico DevLake" 

- When referring to the DevLake community, there are a few important things to consider: 
  - When referring to the community broadly, you are welcome to use the branded terminology "DevLakers"
  - When referring to the core leadership of DevLake please be sure to use the appropriate titles:
    - Hezheng Yin (Creator of DevLake, Apache DevLake PMCC Member, and/or DevLake Lead Maintainer)
    - Louis Zhang (DevLake Lead Maintainer, Apache DevLake PMCC Member) 
    - Joshua Poddoku (Lead Developer Evangelist, Apache DevLake) 
    - Maxim Wheatley (Head of Community & Marketing, Apache DevLake PMCC Member)
    - Klesh Huang (Apache DevLake PPMC Member)

Other Important Notes:
- The DevLake community lives in the DevLake Slack group. 
- The DevLake open-source community huddle occurs every other week, at 7am PST on Thursday.
- DevLake community huddle's are recorded, edited, and uploaded on the "Apache DevLake (Incubating)" YouTube channel, typically by 12pm PST the same day.
