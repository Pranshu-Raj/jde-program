## Introduction
The DevLake Junior Developer Evangelist program is a more advanced and focused type of internship program, dedicated to growing and evolving our open-source presence and community for [Apache DevLake (incubating)](https://devlake.apache.org/). 

The program will last three (3) months for the first rotation, and will require a once per week 45 minute team huddle (TBD time/day based on time-zones and cohort availabilities), and approximately eight (8) hours per week of effort/work/deliverables.

Upon successful completion of the program, the participants will be provided a certificate and letter of completion, as well as a recommendation letter. Furthermore, successful candidates might be invited to continue on in their role in a part-time, full-time, or consulting capacity upon mutual agreement. 

For DevLake, this program will support the continued growth and development of the project and community by expanding content, visibility, and documentation. 

## Core Goals

- Grow DevLake Adoption/Implementation in Open-Source Projects (Seed/Pilot Users)
